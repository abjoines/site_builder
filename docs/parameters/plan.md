## Homework Review


### Plan


What did you make this week?

*groups, 5 minutes*

In your assigned team, choose 1 or 2 sketches from the past week and use them to illustrate your answer to your team's question.

*class, 6x2 minutes*

Share your chosen sketch, comment on it and summarize your discussion.


### Groups

| 1     | Jack, Aakanksha, Patricia<br/>When allowing chance to influence their artwork, does an artist give up authorship?                                                         |
| 2     | Dahee, Earl, Carla<br/>Choose two sketches that you believe demonstrate a baising technique discussed last week. What kind of bias do you think was used in each?         |
| 3     | Julian, Max, Madison<br/>Does computationally generated art have an inherent aesthetic?                                                                                   |
| 4     | Ting, Mario, Xu<br/>Choose a work that combines procedural and non-procedural elements well. What works about this piece?                                                 |
| 5     | Leah, Allysa, Kirsten<br/>Choose a project that presents an interesting direction for further design inquiry. Suggest 5 possible avenues of development for this project. |
| 6     | Bella, Patrick, Rik<br/>The challenge is not a competition. But who won?                                                                                                  |
