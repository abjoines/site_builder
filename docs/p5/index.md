[[ p5 vs Processing]]

## What p5 is

From the p5js homepage:

::: .callout
p5.js
: is a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of Processing, to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and reinterprets this for today’s web.
/::

P5 is a javascript library for making drawings and animations. It makes getting set up and working faster and provides simple functions for common tasks. It also allows for a more imperative programming style, similar to Processing.

If you have never worked with Processing or p5, you’ll need to do some reading and learning on your own. Here are some resources to get you started quickly:

## Getting Started Sketching in p5

For the first few weeks, we'll be using p5 for our sketches. Rather than create a separate project repo for each sketch, keep your sketches organized on one repo. I've created a template project for your sketches.

We'll run through these steps to get up and running with the template together in class.

- Starting a New Project
  - Create a Github Account / Log Into Github
  - Create a Repo on Github
  - Clone the Repo to Your Computer, With Github for Mac
  - Add/Modify A `README.md` File
  - Commit the Files
  - Push Your Commits
  - Check `github.com` to confirm your `README.md` synced.


- Use the Class p5 Sketches Template
  - Download —**Don't Fork**— the Template
  - Add the Files to Your Project
  - Verify the Starter Sketches Work
  - Commit and Push

- Duplicate a template sketch

- Start Sketching!




### Some Basic Examples

[[ 2 or 3 very basic examples that show the drawing api, maybe one of them is a little more complicated, procedrual coolness ]]

## What Git and Github Are

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a version control system. As you work on a project it will grow and change. Git keeps track of the changes you make to the files in your project, keeping a valuable history. With version control, you can review changes to a file over time and you can revert a single file or entire project to an earlier version if (when) something goes wrong. Git also provides powerful tools for sharing your work with others and merging the work of teammates.

[Github](http://www.github.com) is a service that hosts software projects that use Git. Github builds on Git, adding features for collaborative coding such as bug tracking and code reviews. Github hosts a huge array of open-source and private projects and libraries.

Normally, you use the Git software through its command line interface. If you are not comfortable using the command line, you won't be comfortable using Git in this way. [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a simple graphical user interface for Git, with added integration with Github. Github desktop isn't as powerful as the command line interface, but it can cover the basic workflows we'll use in class.
