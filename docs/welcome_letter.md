The Syllabus is on the class website. Read it now!

**Bring three questions about the syllabus, typed on paper, to the first class.**


# Be on Time
The short version of my attendance policy:
**Attend every class, arrive early, stay late.**

Bring these things to Friday's class and to every class:
**laptop + a Comp Form sketchbook + red pen + black pen + pencil + camera/phone**
