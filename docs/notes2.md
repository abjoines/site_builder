# Research Assistance

- General copy editing
- Find, add link and footer references (see: content / references)
- Code style cleanup
  - `var` to `let`

# Content




## Meta Data

## Template + Style


## References
- Find more, better, and more varied sources. 
- Too many Wikipedia links. Parameters has way to many, for example.
- Parameters might have too many side-bar references.
- Consider placement of references between sidebar and bottom.
- Should sidebar sources be repeated on bottom?
- Change "Reference Links" to "Suggested Reading"?

## Copy Style
- use bold (and italics) in the copy to improve variety and scanability

# Publishing System

## Template

## markdown_builder.js


## JSLab
- x.needs a hidden code mode (just run the sketch)
- .hidden code mode is just js-show, it doesn't do onScroll load unload, but that might be needed later

## Styles

## QA Concerns

- i took out trimlines on the ::: /:: blocks. any regressions?
- added debug=false to gulp-layout options to suppress pug console bart. any regressions?

# Research + Ideas

## Research to Include
- links from r/proceduralgeneration top alltime

# Chapter Idea: Number Bending
- talk about combining funcitons, talk about arrays as funcitons, talk about sequences from random as funcitons.
- e.g. a noisy random fuzz + a big square wav
- Look at scaling and offseting numbers, talk about map to do it
- Talk about lerp.
- Talk about pow(x, y) as a way to sharpen or blunt slopes
