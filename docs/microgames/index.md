## Microgames

Minigames are small video games included within a larger video game. They are often included to add variety to the larger game or as [easter eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)). BioShock—a first person shooter—used a minigame version of Pipe Dream—a classic puzzler—as the mechanic used to hack doors and machines. Final Fantasy 7 introduced a Chocobo Racing minigame that allowed players to capture, breed, and race large, rideable birds. In Animal Crossing players can decorate their home with playable NES games. 

Some games are made up almost entirely of minigames. Party games like Mario Party, Rayman: Raving Rabbids, and 1-2-Switch allow players to compete in a series of minigame events. Evoland I + II are RPGs that mix many video game styles and mechanics both through minigames and by evolving the presentation of the main game itself.

Minigames are are often a beloved part of the games they are in. They offer a change of pace from the main game, reducing fatigue. They are usually low stakes, reducing stress. A well placed minigame can improve the pacing of the main game significantly. Offering an break before a spike in the action will increase the apparent contrast in the intensity. 

Minigames don't have to carry the weight of a full game. They don't have advance the story or provide the amount of mechanics, levels, and content expected of full games. They are free to focus on a small set of ideas, deliver some fun game play, and move on.

The [WarioWare](hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wario_(franchise)) series debuted in 2003 on the Game Boy Advance. WarioWare presented the player with a rapid-fire sequence of microgames. These games pushed the single-minded focus of minigames as far as possible resulting in games that often demanded only a single action from the player and took just seconds to play. As soon as the player completed one challenge, another would begin.
