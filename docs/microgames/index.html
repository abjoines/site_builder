<p>Minigames are small video games included within a larger video game. They are often included to add variety to the larger game or as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)">easter eggs</a>. BioShock—a first person shooter—used a minigame version of Pipe Dream—a classic puzzler—as the mechanic used to hack doors and machines. Final Fantasy 7 introduced a Chocobo Racing minigame that allowed players to capture, breed, and race large, rideable birds. In Animal Crossing players can decorate their home with playable NES games.</p>
<p>Some games are made up almost entirely of minigames. Party games like Mario Party, Rayman: Raving Rabbids, and 1-2-Switch allow players to compete in a series of minigame events. Evoland I + II are RPGs that mix many video game styles and mechanics both through minigames and by evolving the presentation of the main game itself.</p>

<p>Minigames are are often a beloved part of the games they are in. They offer a change of pace from the main game, reducing fatigue. They are usually low stakes, reducing stress. A well placed minigame can improve the pacing of the main game significantly. Offering an break before a spike in the action will increase the apparent contrast in the intensity.</p>
<p>Minigames don’t have to carry the weight of a full game. They don’t have advance the story or provide the amount of mechanics, levels, and content expected of full games. They are free to focus on a small set of ideas, deliver some fun game play, and move on.</p>

<p>The <a href="hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wario_(franchise)">WarioWare</a> series debuted in 2003 on the Game Boy Advance. WarioWare presented the player with a rapid-fire sequence of microgames. These games pushed the single-minded focus of minigames as far as possible resulting in games that often demanded only a single action from the player and took just seconds to play. As soon as the player completed one challenge, another would begin.</p>
