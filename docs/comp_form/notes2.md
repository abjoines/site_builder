# Content

## Meta Data
- Lets get rid of the number in the titles

## Template + Style
- hero header: change "the what" "the how" to something better
- On mobile the activities need to be full bleed.

## Copy Style
- TOP LEVEL HEADERS Rearrange content to make the best use of numbered/top level headers
- use bold (and italics) in the copy to improve variety and scanability
- no colons on headers
- Make bottom links better. Also some content rules. How many? Should they have descriptions? What content (see also, examples, tutorials, dan?)
- Too many Wikipedia links.
  Parameters has way to many, for example. Find better/more varied sources. Maybe even just cut down the references.

## Assignment Review Questions

## In-class Challenges 
- all of them

## Lesson Plans
- I made lesson plans for several of these classes in '17.
- Make more lesson plans
- Format them consistently
- Make the accessible through site
- lesson plans in the header?
- are they all formatted the same (title case)
- using Engage, Study, Activate Terminalogy for all?
- Do i use "Activity:" and "Lecture:" and "Discussion:" consistently?
- maybe lesson plans have the schedule, and the class specific info (like teams, etc?)
- make a T-15 minute entry for the song of the day, video of the day, etc.
- Need a Link to the Plans, each chapter? a single list? both?

# Publishing System

## Template
- next/prev links should be omitted if false

## markdown_builder.js
- trimlines is eating whitespace in code parts... we don't want to trim whitespace in there, but generally do want to trim it elsewhere? hmm

## JSLab
- needs a full-screen mode

# Research + Ideas

## Research to Include
- links from r/proceduralgeneration top alltime

# Chapter Idea: Number Bending
- talk about combining funcitons, talk about arrays as funcitons, talk about sequences from random as funcitons.
- e.g. a noisy random fuzz + a big square wav
- Look at scaling and offseting numbers, talk about map to do it
- Talk about lerp.
- Talk about pow(x, y) as a way to sharpen or blunt slopes
