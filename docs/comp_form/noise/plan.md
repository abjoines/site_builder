### Parameters Review Questions

In your assigned team, choose 1 or 2 sketches from the past week and use them to illustrate your answer to your team's question.

Group   | Question
---     | ---
1       | Choose a work that did something unexpected with parameters. Discuss.
2       | Choose a work that you 1) like and 2) don't know how how it was made. Describe what you see.
3       | Choose a work that combined elements from a previous week with parameters. Discuss.
4       | Who had the widest "apparent" parameter space?
5       | The challenge is still not a competition, but who won?
