## Week 4, Noise {plain}

### Materials
1D Noise Worksheet

### Learning Objectives
- What the `noise()` function does.
- When, why, and how to use `noise()`
- Sampling, mapping, and controlling `noise()`
- Using `noise()` vs using `random()`
- Importance of Perlin Noise in Procedural Generation
- Qualities of Noise (Frequency, Amplitude, Smoothing, Layering, Dimensions)

### Parameters Review Questions

In your assigned team, choose 1 or 2 sketches from the past week and use them to illustrate your answer to your team's question.

| Group | Question                                                                                     |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Choose a work that did something unexpected with parameters. Discuss.                        |
| 2     | Choose a work that you 1) like and 2) don't know how how it was made. Describe what you see. |
| 3     | Choose a work that combined elements from a previous week with parameters. Discuss.          |
| 4     | Who had the widest "apparent" parameter space?                                               |
| 5     | The challenge is still not a competition, but who won?                                       |
