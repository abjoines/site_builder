| 1     | Choose a common theme that has appeared in several pieces. Discuss the theme and two example sketches.                   |
| 2     | Choose a sketch that visualizes sound. Discuss the relationship between the sound and visual.                            |
| 3     | Choose a computational sound. Try to describe the sound in detail, so that someone could recreate it without hearing it. |
| 4     | Choose a work with a strong audio-visual relationship that is not an audio visualization.                                |
| 5     | Many of the sounds generated have a similar sound. Choose a sketch that achieves a unique character.                     |
| 6     | The challenge is not a competition. Who won?                                                                             |

## Notes

We are doing music!
1. Good response last week, and a high interest for more audio.
2. Some very good sketches this week.
3. We didn't cover _any_ comp sound tactics.
4. We didn't cover _any_ comp sound precedents.
5. I thought about why the music week went poorly last time, and decided that the problem isn't that many of you don't have a musical background. The problem is that I planned a lesson that needed one and tried to crash-course a music background it too little time, with too little knowledge.
6. I really liked using these speakers.

But the real reason is:
- What do you think about me? 
  1. I care about this class and am willing to put in as much as I expect from you
  2. That I'm still learning. 
- [Job Talk: Teaching Philosophy](http://psam3060-d-s16.github.io/class_notes/philosophy/)
- Jean Piaget: Constructivism
- Learning is an active process of reconstructing knowledge, rather than a transfer of knowledge
- Learning is rooted in experience.
- Seymour Papert: Contructionism (Epistemology and Learning Research Group)
- student-centered, project-based learning
- learning is supported by an environment rich in models of different types
- our individual knowledge is network of existing ideas and models
- learning is individual and based on available models
- I now believe that
- you can learn to be smarter, developing a strong network ideas makes learning new ideas easier
- Comp Form: student-centered, activity-based, variety of models, even the blog post
- Music: worked in reverse for me, learning about music helped me reframe my exisiting models
