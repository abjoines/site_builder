# Meta Data
- Lets get rid of the number in the titles

# system
- next/prev links should be omitted if false

# markdown_builder.js
- trimlines is eating whitespace in code parts... we don't want to trim whitespace in there, but generally do want to trim it elsewhere? hmm

# Type formatting
- use bold (and italics) in the copy to improve variety and scanability

- no colons on headers

# Lesson Plans
- I made lesson plans for several of these classes in '17.
- Make more lesson plans
- Format them consistently
- Make the accessible through site
- lesson plans in the header?
- maybe lesson plans have the schedule, and the class specific info (like teams, etc?)



# File Org
- chapter
  - sketches
  - slides
  - figures
  index.md
  ...included yaml and md

# Top Level Headers
- Rearrange content to make the best use of numbered/top level headers

# Content Notes
- hero header: change "the what" "the how" to something better
- Make bottom links better. Also some content rules. How many? Should they have descriptions? What content (see also, examples, tutorials, dan?)
- Too many Wikipedia links.
  Parameters has way to many, for example. Find better/more varied sources. Maybe even just cut down the references.

# JSLab
- needs a full-screen mode


# Chapter: Number Bending
- talk about combining funcitons, talk about arrays as funcitons, talk about sequences from random as funcitons.
- e.g. a noisy random fuzz + a big square wav
- Look at scaling and offseting numbers, talk about map to do it
- Talk about lerp.
- Talk about pow(x, y) as a way to sharpen or blunt slopes
