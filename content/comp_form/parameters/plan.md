### Random Review Questions

In your assigned team, choose 1 or 2 sketches from the past week and use them to illustrate your answer to your team's question.

Group   | Question
---     | ---
1       | When working with random values, does an artist give up control or authorship?
2       | Choose a sketch that you believe demonstrates the use of biased random values. What kind of bias do you think was used?
3       | Can computational generated work feel "natural"?
4       | Choose a work that combines procedural and non-procedural elements well. What works about this piece?
5       | The challenge is not a competition. But who won?
