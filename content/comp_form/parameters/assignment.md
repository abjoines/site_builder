## Keep Sketching!

### Base
Continue experimenting with procedurally generated images, this time focus on exposing parameters and exploring the parameter spaces of your sketches. You can mix random and parametric elements, but I suggest doing at least a couple of sketches that are not random at all.{bigger}

### Challenge: Face Generator
Build a face generating tool. This tool will create an image of a face that can be adjusted by the user with sliders and other inputs.

- Don’t use the built in shape drawing commands like rect and ellipse. Build your face from hand-drawn or photographic images.
- Make your resulting images look as seamless and cohesive as possible.
- Inputs can range from straight-forward (eye color, nose size) to complex (anger, lighting).

### Special Assignment
Later in this class I will ask you to create special sketches using equipment available to you through The New School. If you haven’t used the following equipment before, you should sign up for orientations. Be ready to use this equipment by the sixth week of classes.

- Laser Cutter
- 3D Printers
- Large Format Printers/Plotters
- CNC Mills (optional)
