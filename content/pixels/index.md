## Pixel Data

Today, most computers use color displays that produce images using a grid of pixels. Conceptually, each pixel is made up of three sub-pixels—red, green, and blue—though the actual hardware may use a different pattern. Because these pixels are very close together, the image appears continuous.  Because our eyes can only directly perceive red, green, and blue, the screen can reproduce most of the colors we are capable of seeing.

When you work with a graphics library like p5.js or the Javascript [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API), you don't have to think about individual pixels. You can use high-level methods like `ellipse()` and `image()`, and the library will do the low-level work—setting individual pixel values—for you. The process of converting shapes to pixels is called _rasterization_. The p5.js drawing calls abstract away a lot of the details. When you draw a circle with `ellipse()` every pixel in the circle will be changed to current `fill()` color. `ellipse()` provides no way to fill the ellipse with random colors, or a gradient, or colors generated by a function. To get this level of control, you need to take control of the rasterization yourself. This is the high-level/low-level trade-off. Coding at a low-level takes more work but offers more control.

Working directly with the pixels—reading and writing their red, green, and blue values one-by-one—leads to thinking about drawing with code differently.

### Vector Monitors

Computer displays don't have to use pixels at all. One of the earliest video games, [Tennis for Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_for_Two), used a cathode ray oscilloscope as its display.  In a cathode ray oscilloscope, signals are drawn by magnetically deflecting a beam of electrons as they race from an emitter—the cathode—towards a phosphor-coated glass screen. The phosphor glows where the electrons strike it, creating an image.


[Vector Monitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_monitor) were used in later video games as well, including the [Tempest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_(video_game)) arcade game and several games for the [Vectrex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectrex) home console.

### Video Memory

An high-definition display is 1920 pixels wide and 1080 tall: 345,600 total pixels. Each pixel needs three bytes to represent its color value, one byte each for the red, green, and blue channels. In total that is 6,220,800 bytes—about 6 megabytes—of memory to keep track the full HD image. This data is usually kept in the video card's VRAM, but might also be kept in the computer's main RAM. The display hardware repeatedly works through every pixel on the screen, changing its brightness based on the values in RAM. If you change the values in the RAM, a new picture appears on the screen. 

In reality, modern video pipelines are more complicated than this, but at some level this is basically what is going on.


::: .callout
Today, six megabytes isn't much but many older computers didn't have enough RAM to keep a full-color image of the screen in memory at all. They used a [variety of tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfh0ytz8S0k) instead.
/::


### The Pixels Array

The memory representing the image shown on the screen is called the video buffer or framebuffer. Direct access to the screen's framebuffer is pretty rare on modern computers, and libraries like p5.js don't provide it.  P5.js _does_ give you access to a pixel buffer representing the image shown on your sketch's canvas. When you call p5.js drawing functions like `rect()` and `ellipse()` p5 updates the appropriate values in this buffer. This buffer is then composited into the rendered webpage by the browser and shown in the browser's window. The browser window is composited onto the screen by the OS.

/::

You can read and write pixel values with the `get()` and `set()` methods. These methods are easy to use, but they are really, really slow. With a little bit of math, you can work directly with the `pixels` array data. This is a little more work but can easily be thousands of times faster.



### Rasterization
[p5 rasterizes high-level descriptions to pixel values as you go (immediate mode?)]
[vector images are rasterized before they are shown]

### Raster vs. Vector Images

Raster and Vector images are conceptually very different. 


Raster images are represented as samples

[How raster images are stored in memory]

[Not just about scalability. Scalability is the most often mentioned difference between raster and vector images, but other differences exist as well. Because vector images are described at a higher level—shapes instead of pixels—they are also easier to distort, recolor, change the stroke, etc. Not all images can be reasonably described as a collection of shapes. Photographic images, in particular, have too much detail to store as a collection of shapes. Similarly, some types of effects that consume or produce pixel-level detail require raster data, more information about what the images is made of, rather than what it looks like now]

## Writing Pixel Data

[intro?]

### A Basic Example

The p5.js library provides two ways to read and write image pixel data. First,you can use `get()` and `set()` which are a bit easier but slower. Second you can access the `pixels[]` array directly, which is faster but requires some math to find the address of the pixel you want to work with.

This example uses `set()` to create some random pixel data.

::: js-lab
/pixels/sketches/basic_pixels.js
/::


Let's look at the code in depth.



Line 10
: Use `createImage()` to create a new, empty image in memory. We can draw this image just like an image lowed from a `.jpg` or `.gif`.

Line 11
: Use `loadPixels()` to tell p5 that we want to access the pixels of the image for reading or writing. You must call `loadPixels()` before using `set()`, `get()`, or the `pixels[]` array.

Line 13
: Set up a nested loop. The inner content of the loop will be run once for every pixel.

Line 15
: Use the `color()` function to create a color value, which is assigned to `c`. Color values hold the R, G, B, and A values of a color. The color function takes into account the current `colorMode()`.

Line 16
: Use `set()` to set the color of the pixel at `x, y`.

Line 20
: Use `updatePixels()` to tell p5 we are done accessing the pixels of the image.

Line 22
: Use `noSmooth()` to tell p5 not to smooth the image when we scale it; we want it pixelated. This Photoshop's 'nearest neighbor' scaling method.

Line 23
: Draw the image, filling the canvas so we can clearly see each pixel.


### Gradient Example

This example has the same structure as the first one, but draws a gradient pixel-by-pixel.

::: js-lab
/pixels/sketches/basic_pixels_2.js
/::


Line 15
: Instead of choosing a color at random, this example calculates a color based on the current `x` and `y` position of the pixel being set.


### Random Access Example

The first two examples use a nested loop to set a value for every pixel in the image; it visits every pixel in a sequential order. That pattern is commonly used in pixel generating and processing scripts, but not always. This example places red pixels at random places on the image.

## Reading Pixel Data


The p5.js library also allows you to read pixel data, so you can process images or use images a inputs. These examples use this low-res black-and-white image of Earth.

<img class="scale pixel" style="image-rendering: pixelated; height: 120px;" src="sketches/world.png" />


### Read Pixels Example 1

This example loads the image of Earth, loops over its pixels, and multiplies each pixels color with a random color.

::: js-lab
/pixels/sketches/read_pixels.js
/::



#### First we need to load an image to read pixel data from.

Line 3
: Declare a variable to hold our image.

Line 5
: The `preload()` function. Use this function to load assets. p5.js will wait until all assets are loaded before calling `setup()` and `draw()`

Line 6
: Load the image.

#### With our image loaded we can process the pixels.


Line 18
: Set up a nested loop to cover every pixel.

Line 20 
: Use `get()` to load the color data of the current pixel. `get()` returns an array like `[255, 0, 0, 255]` with components for red, green, blue, and alpha.

Lines 22, 23, 24
: Read the red, blue, and green parts of the color.

Line 25
: Create the new color for the pixel by multiplying the current color values with a random 0-1 value.

Line 27
: Change the pixel to our new color.

Line 28
: Uses `updatePixels()` to tell the image there has been an update. We didn't need to do this in every pass through the loop when we were just setting pixels, but here we mix `set()` and `get()`. p5.js requires calling `updatePixels()` anytime we switch from setting to getting or drawing.


### Read Pixels Example 2

This example compares each pixel to the one below it. If the upper pixel is darker, it is changed to magenta.

::: js-lab
/pixels/sketches/read_pixels_2.js

### Image as Input Example

This example doesn't draw the image at all. Instead, the image is used as an input that controls where the red ellipses are drawn. Using images an inputs is a powerful technique that allows you to mix manual art and procedurally generated content.

### Modify Example 1
1. Colorize the white pixels with a vertical black to red gradient.
2. Colorize the black pixels with a vertical black to green gradient.
3. Feed the program you made above a grayscale or color image (under 100x100). <br/> You'll have to do this in your own editor, and you'll need a local server.

<img src="sketches/world_100.png" style="image-rendering: pixelated;">


### Modify Example 2
4. Change the color comparison to `>`.
5. Change the color comparison to `!=`.
6. Change `out_color` to an average of the two color samples.
7. Feed the program you made above the grayscale earth image above.
{continue}

### Modify Example 3
8. Invert the drawing, so that circles appear where the input pixels are black.
9. Feed the program you made above the grayscale earth image above.
10. Use lightness to drive the circle sizes.
{continue}

### Challenging Challenges
11. Start with the original Example 2 code, without your changes. Set `out_color` to the average of `this_color` and `below_color`.
12. Change `worldImage.set(x, y, out_color);` to `worldImage.set(x, y+1, out_color);`.
13. Remove the conditional statement (keep its contents).
{continue}

## Advanced Topics


### The Canvas + Pixel Density
When accessing the pixel data of the canvas itself, you need to consider the pixel density p5 is using. By default p5 will create a 2x resolution canvas when running on a high-dpi (retina) display. You can call `pixelDensity(1)` to disable this feature. If you don't, you'll need to take into account the density when calculating a position in the `pixels[]` array.

The examples on this page work with the pixels of images instead of the canvas to avoid this issue altogether.



### Performance

The built-in p5 `someImage.get(x, y)` function gets the RGBA values of a pixel in an image. As noted in the [reference](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/get), the get call is slower than accessing the values in the `someImage.pixels[]` array directly. In fact, `get()` can be 1000s of times slower. Under the hood, `get()` reads the colors of every pixel in the image before returning the value you request.

We can get much faster results by loading the pixel values **once** with `loadPixels()`, and then reading from the `pixels[]` array directly.

The `getQuick()` funciton below reads a pixels color value from an image's `pixels[]` array. You must call `loadPixels()` before calling this funciton.

```javascript
// find the RGBA values of the pixel at x, y in the img's pixels array
// use instead of p5s built in .get(x,y), for much better performance (more than 1000x better in many cases)
// see: http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/pixels[]
// we don't need to worry about screen pixel density here, because we are not reading from the screen

function getQuick(img, x, y) {

	var i = (y * img.width + x) * 4;
	return [
		testImage.pixels[i],
		testImage.pixels[i+1],
		testImage.pixels[i+2],
		testImage.pixels[i+3],
	];
}
```

Copy the `getQuick()` function above into your sketch. You can then replace a built in p5 `get` call with a call to `getQuick`:


#### Using `get()`
```javascript
// in loop
c = img.get(x, y);
```

#### Using `getQuick()`
```javascript
// before loop
img.loadPixels();

// in loop
c = getQuick(img, x, y);
```

The following example compares the performance of using `get()` and `getQuick()` to read and invert the color value of a small image.

### `get()` and `set()`


::: .callout .warn
The `get()` and `set()` methods are easy to use, but they are really, really slow.
/::


<!-- 
### Using the `pixels` array

The p5.js `pixels` array holds four color values—red, green, blue, and alpha—for every pixel on the canvas. Images are two dimensional, but the `pixels` array is one dimensional. In order to read or write values in the `pixels` array, you need to find the index—the position in the array—of your target pixel. To do that, you need to know how the data is laid out. In p5.js the upper left pixel is the first pixel in the array and the other pixels follow left to right, top to bottom. Each pixel is represented by four values: red, green, blue, and alpha.

```
[r, g, b, a, r, g, b, a, r, g, b, a, r, g, b, a, r, g, b, a, r, g, b, a, ...]
 --- p1 ---  --- p2 ---  --- p3 ---  --- p4 ---  --- p5 ---  --- p6 ---
```

With data laid out like this we can find the index values as follows.

```
pixelNumber = y * imageWidth + x;
redIndex = pixelNumber * 4;
greenIndex = pixelNumber * 4 + 1;
blueIndex = pixelNumber * 4 + 2;
alphaIndex = pixelNumber * 4 + 3;
```

[[ diagram ]]

::: .callout .warn
On a high-dpi or retina display, the canvas array may have more values than you expect. When you call `createCanvas(512,512)` on a high pixel density display, p5.js actually creates a canvas that is 1024x1024, or potentially even larger if the display pixel density is very large.

## Keep Sketching! 

### Base

Explore working with image pixel data directly. This week, most of your posts should be still images. You might also consider creating animations. Since p5 pixel access is slow, this technique will pair well with pre-rendering.{bigger}

Post **at least one** sketch **for each** of the following:
1. Generate an image from scratch: pixel by pixel. Don't call any high level drawing function like `ellipse()` or `rect()`.
2. Load an image and process its pixels. Show the result.
3. Use an image as an input source to control a drawing. Don't show the original image, just the output.




### Challenge
Create a pixel Ouroboros. 
Create code that processes an image. Feed the result back into your code and process it again. What happens after several generations?

Post your source image, the result after one generation, and the result after several generations. Alternately, capture 90 generations as frames and post as a video.
