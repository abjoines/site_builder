# Q for Justin
- will we ever have code style without preview? (see p5.js Dom Interfaces)
- different paragraph styles? (see Keep Sketching)
- quick way to make "codey" word in span without adding class? (see ellipseMode())
- where to put dropdown menu content?
- full-width? (see "assignment")
- put assignments in separate file?
